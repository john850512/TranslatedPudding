## What is TranslatedPudding(翻譯布丁)?
Line provides voice message which can be transmitted without type any text. But this type of message is not very convenient for message receiver.There are serveral reasons as follows: 

1. For instance, if you are in a metting or in school, **you can not understand those voice messages cause you can not repeat those voice messages**.
2. Although voice message is very convenient for message sender, but **for message receiver, voice message spends lots of time to get the content(you must repeat it again).**

So TranslatedPudding(翻譯布丁), a line chatbot is created to help you translate voice msg to text msg.

This project's name is inspired by [都拉Ａ夢-翻譯蒟蒻](http://zh.doraemon.wikia.com/wiki/%E7%BF%BB%E8%AD%AF%E8%92%9F%E8%92%BB?variant=zh-tw), just because I like eat pudding more than konjac:|

## How to Use？
Sorry, this chatbot service is not open yet(maybe will open in the feature), but I open source code and you can deploy TranslatedPudding by youself.

When deployment is finish, just add this chatbot into any group and then use it!
