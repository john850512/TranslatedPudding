## What is TranslatedPudding(翻譯布丁)?
Line provides voice message which can be transmitted without typing any text. But this type of message is not very convenient for message receiver. There are serveral reasons as follows: 

1. For instance, if you are in a metting or in school, **you can not understand those voice messages because you can not play those voice messages**.
2. Although voice message is very convenient for message sender, but **for message receiver, voice message spends lots of time to get the content(you must repeat it again).**

So TranslatedPudding(翻譯布丁), a line chatbot is created to help you translate voice msg to text message.

This project's name is inspired by [都拉Ａ夢-翻譯蒟蒻](http://zh.doraemon.wikia.com/wiki/%E7%BF%BB%E8%AD%AF%E8%92%9F%E8%92%BB?variant=zh-tw), just because I like eat pudding more than konjac:|

## How to Use？
The chatbot service is not open yet(maybe will open in the feature), but I provide source codes and you can deploy TranslatedPudding any modify it by youself.

When deployment is finish, just add this chatbot into any group and then use it!

In this chatbot, you can typing three keyword to open/close translation service, or see helping message:
1. `翻譯布丁`: show what keywords you can use. 
2. `吃下翻譯布丁`: open translation service.
3. `布丁消化完了`: close translation service.

btw, when translation mode is on, there exist some easter egg to make funny(try to send some sticker message!)
